# PESEL Database Management

## Description
This project uses a SQL script to create a database called **PESEL** with a table for population data. It includes constraints, triggers for automatic PESEL generation, and example data. A batch script (`.bat`) is provided to execute SQL commands automatically.

## How to Use
1. Run the SQL script to create and populate the database.
2. Use the `.bat` file to execute queries:
   - Ensure paths to SQLCMD and `.sql` files are correctly configured.
   - Modify credentials and server details as needed.
